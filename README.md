# Goldbach Validation: Article and Table for Large Even Numbers

This website demonstrates the validity of Goldbach's Conjecture for very large even numbers, using a predictive method developed by Bahbouhi Bouchaib.

## 🔍 Contents

- A short article describing the method.
- A table of selected large even numbers `E` and a corresponding prime `p` such that `E = p + q`, with both `p` and `q` primes.
- All values of `p` are explicitly verified primes.
- This site shows results up to `E = 10^10000`.
